My name is Kage Peterson.  I am currently studying Computer Information Systems at Wayne State College.

I currently know basic HTML, but I am taking a class on C++ and will be taking more classes later.

I will use this GitHub account to post class projects, and hopefully some personal projects later on.

I tend to figure out problems by breaking them down into pieces, then solving from there.

You can reach me at kapete15@wsc.edu
